//! Lifecycle event outbox: a local JSONL log of session/turn/subagent
//! lifecycle events plus an optional webhook fan-out.
//!
//! This is the machine-readable sibling of the TUI shell-hook system. Hooks
//! fire shell commands per event and are TUI-only; the outbox appends one
//! JSON line per event to a config-gated file and needs no per-event
//! configuration. It is additive and opt-in: with no path configured,
//! [`LifecycleOutbox::emit`] is a no-op.
//!
//! # Line schema
//!
//! Every line is a `codewhale_protocol::runtime::RuntimeEventEnvelope`:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"schema_version": 1, "seq": 3, "event": "turn_start", "kind": "turn.started",
//!  "thread_id": "…", "turn_id": "…", "item_id": null, "timestamp": "…",
//!  "created_at": "…", "payload": {…}}
//! ```
//!
//! - `seq` is unique and monotonic per outbox file. Every append takes an
//!   exclusive advisory lock on a `<path>.lock` sidecar file (`flock` on
//!   Unix, `LockFileEx` on Windows) and holds it across the recovery of the
//!   last complete line's `seq` (bounded tail scan, so an outbox that grows
//!   unbounded is never re-read in full) and the append itself — concurrent
//!   writers sharing one file (many codewhale sessions on one machine)
//!   cannot duplicate seqs or append them out of order.
//! - `event` is the snake-case lifecycle name (`turn_start`, `turn_end`, …);
//!   `kind` is the dotted kind (`turn.started`, `turn.failed`, …).
//! - Payloads are constructed by the emit sites from bounded, pre-redacted
//!   fields only — never raw tool arguments, environment, or full transcript
//!   text. [`bounded_text`] enforces the same ceilings as the desktop
//!   notification payloads: headline ≤ 80, detail ≤ 120, preview ≤ 200
//!   characters.
//!
//! # Delivery model
//!
//! [`LifecycleOutbox::emit`] never blocks the caller: it enqueues the event
//! on an internal channel and a single writer task appends lines in order;
//! concurrent writers sharing one file are serialized by the outbox's
//! per-append exclusive lock. If no tokio runtime is available the event is
//! dropped with a warning. At shutdown, [`LifecycleOutbox::close`] +
//! [`LifecycleOutbox::flush_blocking`] / [`LifecycleOutbox::flush`] drain the
//! queue under a deadline and the writer's completion receipt proves how many
//! events landed — a bounded, deterministic exit flush for surfaces that
//! would otherwise exit with events still in flight.
//! Webhook POSTs (`{"at": …, "event": …}`) fan out after the local append,
//! off the append path: delivery uses bounded retries inside the sink (two
//! retries with exponential back-off) and failures are logged and dropped,
//! never fed back into the agent loop. The fan-out is itself bounded — at
//! most [`WEBHOOK_MAX_IN_FLIGHT`] deliveries run concurrently, and a full
//! backlog drops the newest delivery instead of queueing it.
//!
//! # Session ownership of turn boundaries
//!
//! A session owns its turn events: the process that starts a turn is the
//! one that ends it — except when it cannot. A session killed mid-turn
//! (SIGKILL, a closed pane, a crashed host) dies between the `turn_start`
//! and `turn_end` appends, leaving an unpaired `turn_start` in the file.
//! Ownership is keyed on a **stable cross-process identity** (one persisted
//! id per surface, claimed for the session lifetime), so the next launch of
//! the same surface emits under the same id and can find the killed
//! process's records.
//!
//! - **Graceful shutdown** closes the loop for catchable signals: the TUI's
//!   terminating-signal task calls [`LifecycleOutbox::reconcile_interrupted_turns_bounded`]
//!   before exiting, which appends a synthetic `turn_end`
//!   (`status: "interrupted"`, `payload.reconciled: true`, a `reason` naming
//!   the signal) for every turn this session left open. The whole flush runs
//!   under a total deadline (lock wait + scan + appends), so a wedged or
//!   contended outbox can never trap the exit.
//! - **SIGKILL runs no code**, so nothing can be appended at death; that is
//!   what **boot reconciliation** covers: on the next session start the
//!   session calls [`LifecycleOutbox::reconcile_interrupted_turns`] again
//!   (reason `boot_reconciliation`) and the same scan pairs anything the
//!   killed process left behind. The session owns its events across process
//!   lifetimes.
//!
//! Both paths derive the open turn from the *file* (a `turn_start` with no
//! matching `turn_end` for the same `thread_id`), never from in-memory
//! state, so a signal handler that races the writer task cannot fabricate a
//! duplicate `turn_end`. The scan and the appends run under the outbox's
//! exclusive lock, so two reconcilers (or a reconciler racing another
//! session's writer) serialize and never double-append.
//!
//! # Crash consistency
//!
//! A crash mid-append leaves a torn trailing line. Recovery **repairs** it
//! rather than ignoring it: under the lock, the torn suffix is truncated
//! away before the next append, so torn JSON and the new envelope can never
//! fuse into one unparseable line. A hard per-line ceiling
//! ([`MAX_OUTBOX_LINE_BYTES`], below the recovery window) is enforced at the
//! append choke point, so the tail scan can always reach the last complete
//! line.
