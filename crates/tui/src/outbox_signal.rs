//! Session-owned outbox events at terminating-signal time.
//!
//! The outbox's turn boundaries are normally emitted engine-side; a session
//! killed mid-turn by a catchable signal (SIGTERM from a pane teardown,
//! SIGHUP from a closed pane, SIGINT) never reaches the `turn_end` emit, so
//! its `turn_start` would stay unpaired in the shared outbox. This module
//! registers the session's outbox handle and thread identity in a
//! process-global so the terminating-signal cleanup task in
//! [`crate::spawn_signal_cleanup_task`] can append the missing `turn_end`
//! before the process exits.
//!
//! The flush derives the open turn from the *file* via
//! [`codewhale_hooks::LifecycleOutbox::reconcile_interrupted_turns`], never
//! from in-memory turn state: the scan + append run under the outbox's
//! cross-process lock, so the flush can never fabricate a duplicate
//! `turn_end` (G1) even if it races the session's own writer task. SIGKILL
//! runs no code at all; the same reconciliation function covers it at the
//! next boot, which is why both paths share one mechanism.
