# RFC: Lifecycle Event Outbox

**Issue:** #5531
**Status:** Implemented; pending upstream PR
**Date:** 2026-08-20
**Reference:** the shipped contract lives in
[docs/CONFIGURATION.md](../CONFIGURATION.md) ("Lifecycle Outbox").
This RFC is the review artifact, modeled
on [1364-hooks-lifecycle.md](1364-hooks-lifecycle.md). Where the two
disagree, this RFC is the proposal and `CONFIGURATION.md` is the shipped
contract.

**Scope:** everything below covers the **TUI runtime** and headless
**`codewhale exec`** v1. The app-server / ACP surfaces are **out of scope**
and the CLI subcommands and the `workflow` tool do not fire the outbox
(see §2). This is the same boundary upstream drew for shell hooks in
RFC 1364, one row further out: where 1364 made lifecycle *hooks* a TUI
feature, this RFC makes the machine-readable *outbox* a TUI + `exec`
feature.

**Issue number note:** the upstream issue has not been filed; `1365` is the
next free RFC number in-tree after 1364 (verified: no collision in
`docs/rfcs/`). When the issue lands, rename this file and re-point the
header.

## 0. Implementation status

Verified against the tree:

| Item | Status | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[lifecycle_outbox]` config table | implemented | `crates/config/src/lib.rs:1553-1575`, wired in `crates/tui/src/tui/app/init.rs:574-586` |
| JSONL writer (locked seq assignment, seq recovery, bounded payloads) | implemented | `crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs` (whole module) |
| `WebhookHookSink` bearer-token transport | implemented | `crates/hooks/src/lib.rs:207-277` |
| TUI emit sites (7 events) | implemented | §4.6 table |
| `exec` emit sites (turn pair + failure pair) | implemented | `crates/tui/src/lib.rs:11673,12082,12279` |
| `workspace` on every event, `subagent` on sub-agent events | implemented | every site in §4.6 |
| `codewhale doctor` posture row | implemented | `crates/tui/src/lib.rs:6031-6044` |
| Tests (unit + config + integration harness) | implemented | §7 |

One deliberate delta from the issue draft's ask, shipped: `turn_failed` is
not a separate event name. A failed turn emits `turn_end` with
`kind: "turn.failed"` (projected from the turn status), on both surfaces
and on both terminal paths. This keeps the envelope's `event`/`kind` split
clean — one event, many kinds — and gives supervisors a single
`turn_start` → `turn_end` pair to correlate.

## 1. Problem

Running codewhale under an external supervisor — a terminal multiplexer
wrapper, an automation harness, an alerting setup — requires a
machine-readable stream of *what happened*: when a turn started, finished,
failed, or stalled; what a sub-agent did; when a session began and ended.
Today a supervisor can only scrape the terminal screen. Specifically:

- **Hooks are TUI-only and per-event shell commands.** The `[hooks]`
  surface (RFC 1364) fires 11 events but runs a configured shell command
  per event, in an interactive TUI session only. Headless
  `codewhale exec` runs fire no hooks at all, and a supervisor must
  install and maintain per-hook commands to get any signal.
- **There is no `turn_start` hook event and no stall signal anywhere.**
  When the stall watchdog recovers a wedged turn, nothing scriptable is
  emitted — the only visibility is a TUI status toast.
- **The durable event store is not populated for interactive sessions.**
  The runtime thread manager keeps a durable per-thread event store with a
  global monotonic `seq` cursor, but it is only written for threads driven
  through the runtime `/v1` HTTP+SSE API — ordinary interactive sessions
  never populate it.
- **Nothing writes lifecycle events to a plain local JSONL file.**

The issue draft's key observation holds: **the event data model and the
JSONL sink plumbing are already there.** `RuntimeEventEnvelope`
(`schema_version, seq, event, kind, thread_id, turn_id, item_id,
timestamp, created_at, payload`) exists in
`crates/protocol/src/runtime/mod.rs:11-27`, and `WebhookHookSink` exists
in `crates/hooks/src/lib.rs:207` but is wired to no config surface. The
outbox composes those two primitives with a config-gated file append and
the existing hook emit sites — no new event model, no new transport.

## 2. Scope

| Surface | Fires the outbox? | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TUI interactive runtime | **Yes** | all seven events (§4.6) |
| `codewhale exec` (headless) | **Yes** | `turn_start` + `turn_end` (both terminal paths) |
| app-server / runtime HTTP API | **No** | durable event store already covers API-driven threads (RFC 1364 precedent: hooks ruled TUI-only) |
| ACP | **No** | same boundary as RFC 1364; extension point for a later RFC |
| CLI subcommands (`doctor`, `/config`, …) | **No** | no lifecycle events fire there |
| `workflow` tool | **No** | same as RFC 1364's ruling for hooks |

Hooks parity, stated explicitly: the outbox covers the observer-event
family of the shell-hook system (`turn_end`, `subagent_spawn`,
`subagent_complete`, `session_start`, `session_end`) **plus the two
events the hook surface lacks** — `turn_start` and `turn_stalled`. The
outbox is independent of the hook command list: sub-agent events fire from
the observer site even when no shell hook is configured for them
(`crates/tui/src/tui/ui.rs:1014-1017`), because the outbox is
configuration-gated once at startup, not per event. This RFC cites the
RFC 1364 scope ruling deliberately: upstream has already drawn the
TUI-only boundary for the shell-hook lifecycle surface; the TUI + `exec`
outbox is the next cell in that same matrix, and the app-server column
stays empty because the durable store already covers it.

## 3. Scope and structure

One PR, layered for review along these seams.

### Config + writer + `WebhookHookSink` token/transport refactor

- add the `[lifecycle_outbox]` table to `crates/config/src/lib.rs`
  (`LifecycleOutboxToml`: `path`, `webhook_url`, `webhook_token`) with the
  absent/empty-`path` = off opt-in idiom, and parse it in the TUI config
  (`crates/tui/src/config.rs:2784-2788`)
- add the JSONL writer module `crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs`
  (envelope assembly, seq recovery, bounded payloads, single writer task)
- refactor `WebhookHookSink` to accept an optional bearer token and share
  its transport with the outbox fan-out (`crates/hooks/src/lib.rs:207-277`);
  the sink was previously dead code with no config surface — this PR gives
  it one

Non-goals: no new runtime dependencies (tokio fs append; the sink's existing
`reqwest` client), no per-event config switches (a
`[lifecycle_outbox.events]` table like `[notifications.events]` is a
plausible later extension, not v1).

### Emit sites per surface — TUI, then exec

Two groups, one per surface, both reviewable against the event table in
§4.6:

- **TUI**: `turn_start`, `turn_end` (completion **and** the
  engine-disconnect folded `turn.failed`), `turn_stalled` at the stall
  watchdog, `subagent_spawn`/`subagent_complete` at the observer site,
  `session_start`/`session_end` at the hook fire sites — every payload
  carrying `workspace`, sub-agent payloads carrying `subagent` (§4.4)
- **exec**: one minted run identity before dispatch — the stable `exec`
  surface id plus a per-run turn id carried by both boundaries — with
  `turn_start` at `Op::SendMessage` dispatch and `turn_end` at the
  terminal `TurnComplete`, **plus** the folded `turn.failed` on the
  "engine channel closed before a terminal receipt" path so every emitted
  `turn_start` has a matching `turn_end`; exec also registers the
  terminating-signal context and runs boot reconciliation, so a killed
  run leaves no permanent orphan

Non-goals: no app-server/ACP sites (scope table), no transcript or tool
payload content — payloads are bounded and pre-redacted only.

### Integration tests

- the consolidated harness module
  `crates/tui/tests/integration/lifecycle_outbox_exec.rs` (registered in
  `crates/tui/tests/integration/main.rs:105`): real `exec` subprocess, a
  `wiremock` OpenAI-compatible stub, isolated `$HOME`/XDG envs, outbox
  line assertions, seq-recovery-across-processes — the recipe
  `exec_turn_usage.rs` / `exec_persistent_service.rs` established
- TUI-side focused tests: stall emit-site tests
  (`crates/tui/src/tui/ui/session_state.rs:1120+`) and the
  engine-disconnect folded-`turn_end` tests

## 4. Design / contract

### 4.1 Config: `[lifecycle_outbox]`

```toml
[lifecycle_outbox]
path = "~/.codewhale/notifications/outbox.jsonl" # unset/empty = OFF
webhook_url = ""     # optional; POSTs events as JSON when set
webhook_token = ""   # optional bearer token for webhook_url
```

- **Opt-in, additive.** Unset or empty `path` = feature off = behavior
  identical to a release without the table (`LifecycleOutboxToml` at
  `crates/config/src/lib.rs:1553-1575`; handle construction at
  `crates/tui/src/tui/app/init.rs:574-586` returns
  `LifecycleOutbox::disabled()` when no path resolves).
- **Table family, not feature flag.** `[lifecycle_outbox]` belongs to
  upstream's config-table family (`[hook_sinks]`, `[notifications]`,
  `[hooks]`, `[transcript]`), not `[features]`, because it carries data
  (path/url/token), not a boolean.
- **Documented example** in `config.example.toml:1192-1203` sits beside the
  `[notifications]` block; the config key drives the real path.

### 4.2 JSONL file contract: `RuntimeEventEnvelope`

Each line is one complete envelope
(`crates/protocol/src/runtime/mod.rs:11-27`):

```json
{"schema_version": 1, "seq": 3, "event": "turn_start", "kind": "turn.started",
 "thread_id": "…", "turn_id": "…", "item_id": null, "timestamp": "…",
 "created_at": "…", "payload": {…}}
```

- **`schema_version`** is `RUNTIME_EVENT_ENVELOPE_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`
  (`crates/protocol/src/runtime/mod.rs:7`), the same envelope the runtime
  event store and `/v1` replay API already use — the outbox introduces no
  second model.
- **`seq` assignment is atomic across processes.** Every append holds an
  exclusive advisory lock on a `<outbox-path>.lock` sidecar file —
  `flock` on Unix, `LockFileEx` on Windows
  (`OutboxFileLock`/`lock_file_exclusive`,
  `crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs:344-441`) — across the
  **bounded 64 KiB tail-scan recovery** of the last complete line's
  `seq` (`recover_last_seq`, `crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs:451`)
  **and** the O_APPEND write itself, so `seq` is unique and
  file-order-increasing across concurrent writers sharing one file — the
  machine-wide outbox pattern, where a read-then-append race produced
  duplicate seqs and out-of-order appends. Outbox lines are bounded far
  below the tail window, so the last complete line is always inside it,
  and a torn trailing line from a crash mid-write is **repaired, not
  ignored**: recovery truncates the torn suffix under the lock before the
  next append, so torn JSON and the new envelope can never fuse into one
  unparseable line (`recover_last_seq`, `crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs`).
- **Single writer per process.** `emit` never blocks the caller: it
  enqueues on an unbounded channel and a single lazily-spawned writer
  task serializes appends in order (`ensure_writer_spawned` at
  `crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs:196-227`; `deliver` at `:262`).
  The locked read + append runs on the blocking pool, so the lock never
  stalls an async worker. Appends use O_APPEND with line + newline in a
  single write, mirroring `JsonlHookSink`; within one process the queue
  orders events and across processes the sidecar lock orders appends, so
  writers can interleave *lines* but never splice one and never duplicate
  or reorder a `seq`. With no tokio runtime available (or after the
  writer task is gone) events are dropped with a warning — the outbox is
  observability, not control flow. At shutdown, `close` + `flush` /
  `flush_blocking` drain the queue under a deadline and the writer's
  completion receipt reports the appended count — a bounded, deterministic
  exit flush.
- **Cross-process sharing is supported.** The `<path>.lock` sidecar is a
  zero-byte file created next to the outbox (`outbox_lock_path` at
  `crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs:371`); the lock is advisory, so
  only cooperating outbox writers respect it and downstream readers of
  the outbox file are unaffected. It is released on descriptor close,
  even on crash, so no stale-lock recovery exists.

### 4.3 Bounded payloads

Payloads are constructed by the emit sites from bounded, pre-redacted
fields only — never raw tool arguments, environment, or full transcript
text. Free-form fields pass through `bounded_text`
(`crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs:391+`), which strips control bytes
and ANSI escapes, collapses whitespace, truncates to a character ceiling
(Unicode-scalar counted, UTF-8 safe) with the `…` marker, and enforces
the same ceilings as the desktop notification payloads:
`OUTBOX_HEADLINE_MAX_CHARS` 80, `OUTBOX_DETAIL_MAX_CHARS` 120,
`OUTBOX_PREVIEW_MAX_CHARS` 200, `OUTBOX_PATH_MAX_CHARS` 512
(`crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs:57-59`).
This is the invariant that makes the 64 KiB tail-scan recovery correct:
a line can never approach that window. The invariant is also enforced
mechanically: the append choke point refuses any serialized line above
`MAX_OUTBOX_LINE_BYTES` (60 KiB, below the recovery window) instead of
writing a line that could push the last complete record out of the tail
scan.

### 4.4 Routing fields: `workspace` on every event, `subagent` on sub-agent events

Post-fix state, and a review checkpoint
below guards it: **every** emit site puts `"workspace"` (the resolved
workspace path) in the payload so a consumer can route each event to its
project without guessing, and sub-agent events
(`subagent_spawn`, `subagent_complete`) additionally carry `"subagent"`
(the sub-agent id) alongside the existing `"agent_id"`
(`crates/tui/src/tui/ui.rs:1026-1029`). Before this fix only TUI
`session_start` and exec `turn_start` carried the routing field and a
consumer dropped everything else fail-closed — the RFC's own test plan
(§7) now asserts the field on every event type end to end.

### 4.5 Webhook transport

With `webhook_url` set, every event is additionally POSTed as
`{"at": "<ISO 8601>", "event": {…}}` by `WebhookHookSink`
(`crates/hooks/src/lib.rs:207-277`) — the previously unwired sink, now
shared between the shell-hook sinks and the outbox fan-out:

- **Bearer token**: `new_with_token` attaches
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when `webhook_token` is set; ignored
  when `webhook_url` is unset.
- **Bounded retries**: delivery uses **bounded retries inside the sink**
  (two retries with exponential back-off, 200 ms / 400 ms, 10 s request
  timeout). After the retries are exhausted the failure is logged and
  dropped, **never fed back into the agent loop**, and a failing webhook
  never blocks the local append — the webhook fan-out runs after the file
  append and is independent of its result
  (`crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs:283-297`). This wording
  ("bounded retries inside the sink; failures logged and dropped") is the
  one the docs and changelog must use — the issue draft's "never retried"
  would misdescribe the transport.

### 4.6 Events emitted

| Event | Kind | Site (file:line) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `turn_start` | `turn.started` | TUI `crates/tui/src/tui/ui/event_loop.rs:1452`; exec `crates/tui/src/lib.rs:11673` |
| `turn_end` | `turn.completed` / `turn.failed` / `turn.interrupted` | TUI `TurnComplete` `crates/tui/src/tui/ui/event_loop.rs:1984`; exec `crates/tui/src/lib.rs:12082` (kind projected from terminal status) |
| `turn_end` (failure path) | `turn.failed` | TUI engine-disconnect `crates/tui/src/tui/ui/session_state.rs:387`; exec channel-closed `crates/tui/src/lib.rs:12279` |
| `turn_stalled` | `turn.stalled` | stall watchdog `recover_stalled_runtime_turn` `crates/tui/src/tui/ui/session_state.rs:253`, emit at `:290` |
| `subagent_spawn` | `subagent.spawned` | observer site `crates/tui/src/tui/ui.rs:1017` (fires even with no hooks configured) |
| `subagent_complete` | `subagent.completed` | observer site `crates/tui/src/tui/ui.rs:1037` |
| `session_start` | `session.started` | hook fire site `crates/tui/src/tui/ui/event_loop.rs:479` |
| `session_end` | `session.ended` | hook fire site `crates/tui/src/tui/ui/event_loop.rs:596` |
| `turn_end` (reconciled) | `turn.interrupted` | `LifecycleOutbox::reconcile_interrupted_turns` — boot (`event_loop.rs:495`) and terminating-signal flush (`crates/tui/src/outbox_signal.rs`); payload `status: "interrupted"`, `reconciled: true`, `reason` |

Guarantees both surfaces uphold: **every `turn_start` has a matching
`turn_end`.** A turn killed mid-flight by a disconnected engine (stream
idle/error, crash) emits the folded `turn_end` (`turn.failed`) from the
failure path — the TUI from `handle_turn_orphan`-style recovery in
`session_state.rs:387`, exec from the channel-closed path in
`crates/tui/src/lib.rs:12279`. A supervisor never sees an orphaned
in-progress turn.

### 4.7 Session ownership of turn boundaries (boot + shutdown reconciliation)

A session **owns** its turn events: the process that starts a turn is the
one that ends it — except when it cannot. A session killed mid-turn
(SIGKILL, a closed pane, a crashed host) dies between the `turn_start`
and `turn_end` appends and cannot run the emit. Ownership is keyed on a
**stable cross-process identity**: one id per surface (`tui`, `exec`),
minted once and persisted under the codewhale home
(`crates/tui/src/outbox_identity.rs`), reused on every launch, and
claimed via a non-blocking `flock`/`LockFileEx` for the session lifetime.
A second live instance of the same surface loses the non-blocking acquire
and falls back to an ephemeral id, so two live sessions never share the
pairing key. When the holder dies — SIGKILL included — the kernel drops
the flock and the next boot takes the stable id. A single recovery
mechanism serves both surviving paths:

- **Graceful shutdown.** The TUI's terminating-signal cleanup task
  (`spawn_signal_cleanup_task`, `crates/tui/src/lib.rs:699`) calls
  `LifecycleOutbox::reconcile_interrupted_turns_bounded` (via
  `crates/tui/src/outbox_signal.rs`) for SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP before the
  process exits, appending a synthetic `turn_end` for every turn this
  session left open. The whole flush runs under a total deadline (lock
  wait + scan + appends) so a wedged or contended outbox can never trap
  the exit, and a second fatal signal bypasses the cleanup entirely.
- **Boot reconciliation.** SIGKILL runs no code, so nothing can be
  appended at death. On the next session start the TUI (and exec)
  reconciles *before* its first emit
  (`crates/tui/src/tui/ui/event_loop.rs:507`,
  `crates/tui/src/lib.rs` exec path), and the same scan pairs anything
  the killed process left behind — possible because the relaunched
  session emits under the same stable identity the killed process used.

Both paths derive the open turn from the **file** (a `turn_start` with no
matching `turn_end` for the same `thread_id`), never from in-memory state:
the flush waits (bounded) for the process's own queued events to drain,
then scans the file and appends under the outbox's cross-process
exclusive lock — one lock acquisition across scan + appends — so a
reconciler racing another session's writer (or a second reconciler)
serializes and never double-appends.

The synthetic line is an ordinary envelope:

```json
{"schema_version": 1, "seq": 9, "event": "turn_end",
 "kind": "turn.interrupted", "thread_id": "sess_…", "turn_id": "…",
 "item_id": null, "timestamp": "…", "created_at": "…",
 "payload": {"status": "interrupted", "reconciled": true,
             "reason": "boot_reconciliation" | "signal:SIGTERM",
             "workspace": "…"}}
```

Only the canonical kill shape is repaired — exactly one `turn_start` and
no `turn_end` for a turn. A turn with duplicate starts cannot satisfy a
1:1 pairing consumer no matter what is appended, so it is left alone with
a warning. The synthetic end inherits the start's `payload.workspace` so
workspace-routed consumers keep seeing the same routing field.

## 5. Known limitations

- **`turn_stalled` vs the client stream-idle clock race.** The stall
  watchdog fires only when a turn outlives the stall threshold, but the
  client's stream-idle timeout can terminate a silent turn first —
  observed in the bridge E2E harness: the idle
  timeout always won and `turn_stalled` was not triggerable live; the
  signal was proven via its emit-site test instead. If stall detection is
  a hard product requirement, the watchdog threshold and the client idle
  clock need reconciliation (watchdog below the idle timeout, or an
  engine-level no-event clock). This RFC ships the signal and names the
  race; it does not retune either clock.
- **No app-server / ACP coverage** (§2). The durable event store already
  covers API-driven threads; wiring the outbox into the app-server is a
  deliberate future RFC, not this one.
- **Tailer cursor state is in-memory.** The outbox writes the file; how a
  consumer tails it is the consumer's contract. A consumer that keeps its
  cursor only in memory and the outbox file being deleted + recreated can
  skip events below the stale cursor (observed in the bridge E2E harness,
  of the live-supervisor run) — the recovery is restart-replay, or the
  consumer should reset its cursor on `NotFound` / detect a seq rewind.
- **Cross-process seq uniqueness** (§4.2): every append re-locks the
  `<path>.lock` sidecar and re-recovers the tail, so one shared file
  yields unique, increasing seqs across sessions; the sidecar file is the
  only new on-disk artifact.
- **SIGKILL reconciliation uses a stable cross-process identity** (§4.7):
  boot reconciliation scans for the *current* surface's identity, and the
  identity is persisted per surface and claimed for the session lifetime,
  so a relaunched session pairs a killed process's unpaired start without
  any resumed-session precondition. A concurrent live instance of the
  same surface falls back to an ephemeral id (documented in
  `crates/tui/src/outbox_identity.rs`), which keeps the single-instance
  path — the supported one — fully correct.
- **The exit flush is bounded and deterministic** (§4.2): `close` +
  `flush`/`flush_blocking` drain the queue under a deadline with a writer
  completion receipt; a wedged writer costs at most the deadline and the
  next boot's reconciliation is the backstop. The signal path carries its
  own total budget (lock + scan + appends), and a second fatal signal
  bypasses a stuck cleanup.
- **`exec` mints one run identity before dispatch** (§3): the stable
  `exec` surface id plus a per-run turn id are carried by both
  boundaries, so `turn_start`/`turn_end` pair regardless of the engine's
  later session-id changes; exec registers the signal context and runs
  boot reconciliation like the TUI, so a killed exec run leaves no
  permanent orphan.
- **Webhook-only configuration (url without `path`) parses losslessly but
  does not activate the handle.** The file path is the feature gate;
  webhook-only delivery can be lifted later if wanted.

## 6. Compatibility

- With `[lifecycle_outbox]` unset or empty `path`, zero behavior change:
  the handle is a disabled no-op and no file or HTTP request is ever made
  (`LifecycleOutbox::disabled`, `crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs:140-144`).
- No new third-party runtime dependencies: the append uses std fs on the
  blocking pool under an advisory lock from in-tree `rustix`/`windows-sys`
  (already workspace dependencies), and the webhook reuses the sink's
  existing `reqwest` client.
- No change to the hook system: shell hooks keep their config shape,
  payloads, and TUI-only scope; the outbox rides alongside the existing
  hook fire sites without altering them.
- The envelope is the existing `RuntimeEventEnvelope` — no schema fork,
  no second event model.

## 7. Test plan

Unit (in-module `#[cfg(test)]`), config, and integration harness layers,
matching upstream's test layout:

- **`crates/hooks`** — `crates/hooks/src/lifecycle_outbox.rs:531+`:
  append/schema shape; seq recovery across reopen; missing/empty file;
  torn trailing line repaired under the lock (seed torn tail → append →
  every line parses → reopen → append again; an all-torn file truncates
  and restarts at seq 1); oversized envelopes refused so the recovery
  window stays reachable; emit ordering under the writer task; exit-flush
  drain with the writer's completion receipt (late emits after `close` are
  dropped); bounded lock acquire timing out under contention and the
  budgeted reconcile stopping at its deadline; concurrent writers sharing
  one file (unique, increasing seqs, no lost
  lines — `concurrent_writers_share_one_file_with_unique_increasing_seqs`,
  `:714`);
  disabled-outbox no-ops (incl. webhook-only-without-path);
  `bounded_text` ceilings incl. UTF-8 boundaries and control-byte strip;
  the routing-field contract surviving the envelope round trip
  (`payload_workspace_and_subagent_fields_survive_the_round_trip`,
  `:487`); wiremock webhook bearer-token delivery (`:758`) and webhook
  failure as an error, not a panic (`:791`).
- **`crates/config`** — `crates/config/src/tests.rs:63`
  (off-by-default + full-table parse) and `:102` (webhook optional);
  **`crates/tui`** — `crates/tui/src/config/tests.rs:711`
  (`tui_config_parses_lifecycle_outbox_table`).
- **TUI focused** — `crates/tui/src/tui/ui/session_state.rs:1120+`
  (`stall_outbox_tests`): enabled outbox writes one `turn_stalled` line
  naming the wedged turn; disabled outbox writes nothing and recovery is
  unchanged. Engine-disconnect tests: an in-progress turn gets the folded
  `turn.failed` `turn_end`; a disconnect with no in-progress turn
  fabricates nothing.
- **Integration harness** —
  `crates/tui/tests/integration/lifecycle_outbox_exec.rs` (registered
  `crates/tui/tests/integration/main.rs:105`), filter names
  `integration::lifecycle_outbox_exec::…`: exec `turn_start`/`turn_end`
  assert `payload.workspace` equals the `--workspace` directory end to
  end, and that both boundaries share one minted thread+turn identity;
  no-config writes no file; `outbox_seq_recovers_across_processes`;
  `concurrent_exec_runs_interleave_cleanly_in_one_shared_outbox` (two
  real processes, one file: unique increasing seqs, every line parses);
  `killed_exec_run_is_reconciled_by_the_next_run_on_boot` (real
  two-process kill/relaunch: stalled run SIGKILLed mid-turn, the next
  run's boot reconciliation pairs the orphan under the stable identity).
  Uses the established harness recipe (wiremock OpenAI-compatible stub,
  `CARGO_BIN_EXE_codewhale-tui`, isolated `$HOME`/XDG, `lock_test_env`).
- **Identity unit tests** — `crates/tui/src/outbox_identity.rs`: the
  persisted id survives a restart; a concurrent holder forces an
  ephemeral id; in-process acquire is idempotent; and the boot
  reconciliation pairs a prior session's records under the stable
  identity after the claims are released (the TUI boot path's inputs,
  tested without a terminal).
- **Posture** — `crates/tui/src/lib.rs:6031-6044`
  (`doctor_lifecycle_outbox_posture_line`): `off (default)` /
  `on (path: …)`, tested for both states.

## 8. Review checkpoints

PR 1 is accepted only if:

- unset/empty `path` leaves the feature off with a no-op handle (tested)
- seq recovery is bounded (tail scan, not full re-read), torn trailing
  lines are **repaired** (truncated under the lock, never fused into the
  next append), oversized envelopes are refused, and cross-process seq
  assignment is atomic under the outbox's exclusive sidecar lock —
  concurrent writers sharing one file
  get unique, increasing seqs with no lost lines (tested)
- `emit` never blocks the caller and ordering is preserved under the
  writer task (tested)
- payload bounds are character-counted and UTF-8 safe, with the
  truncation marker (tested)
- the `WebhookHookSink` refactor keeps the existing `HookSink` behavior
  for shell hooks and adds the bearer token only as an optional parameter
  (existing sink tests still pass)
- the docs use "bounded retries inside the sink; failures logged and
  dropped, never fed back into the agent loop" — not "never retried"

PR 2 is accepted only if:

- every emit site's payload carries `workspace`, and sub-agent events
  carry `subagent` alongside `agent_id` (the integration tests assert
  `workspace` end to end)
- `turn_end` fires after completion state is settled, with the kind
  projected from the turn status
- the TUI engine-disconnect path and the exec channel-closed path both
  emit the folded `turn.failed` only when an in-progress turn actually
  exists — no fabricated pairs
- no payload contains raw tool arguments, environment, or transcript text

PR 3 is accepted only if:

- the integration harness runs under the consolidated
  `integration::lifecycle_outbox_exec::…` filter names and both surfaces'
  assertions pass against a real subprocess
- the stall and disconnect tests cover both the enabled-outbox write and
  the disabled-outbox unchanged-behavior sides
